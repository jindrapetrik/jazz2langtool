Jazz Jackrabbit 2 - J2S Language file specification
----------------------------------------------------
Data types:
    UI32 - unsigned integer, 4 bytes little endian
    UI16 - unsigned integer, 2 bytes little endian
    UI8 - unsigned byte

J2S file structure:
 UI32 numTexts                ... number of texts in main section
 UI32 numTextBytes            ... number of bytes these texts occupy
                                 (size of following texts section)
 string[numTexts] texts       ...  null terminated strings (x numTexts)
 UI32[numTexts] stringOffsets ... offsets to each string (x numTexts). 
                                  Offset starts at the end of numTextBytes field
 UI32 numLevels               ... number of level entries
 LevelEntry[numLevels]        ... level entry array - see below
 UI32 numHelpStringBytes      ... number of following bytes of all HelpString entries
 HelpStringEntry[]            ... helpstring entries of levels

 LevelEntry:
    UI8[8] levelName    ... 8 bytes with null terminated name of level, uppercase
    UI8 zero            ... probably lowest textID, but always zero in lang files
    UI8 maxTextID       ... highest textID of this level
    UI16 levelOffset    ... offset starting at the end of numHelpStringBytes field
                            to fist HelpStringEntry which belongs to this level
 
 HelpStringEntry:
    UI8 textID          ... textID of this helpstring in this level
    UI8 textLength      ... number of bytes of following string (its length)
    string helpstring   ... text of the help string (NOT null terminated)
 

Special characters in strings:
    @ - makes new line in helpstring
    # - makes following text colored (each text character has different color)
    ż followed by number 1 to 9 
         - makes following text more shrinked (reduces letter spacing)
         - ż has byte value of 0xa7
         - it can be used also as regular character without the number
         - in Italian and Polish J2S files, ' (0x27) + number  is used instead,
           but it's not working in the game - game displays only the number
           instead of shrinking
           ( Try selecting Polish language and go to Options - Controls 
            [Opcje -Sterowanie] - on the top you se "2Klawiatura 1" )
           I guess this is some encoding bug while editing original files.
